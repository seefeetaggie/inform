The Mesopelagic Border is down of the Epipelagic Zone. "The border between the Mesopelagic and Epipelagic zones are right where you are now, the pressure change confusing your body. It would be a good idea to take better gear if you plan to go right into the Mesopelagic."
Instead of going to the Twilight Zone when the player is not carrying pressure stablizer:
	say "It would be best to take better equipment to handle the pressure changes."

The Twilight Zone is down of the Mesopelagic Border. "This is the official Mesopelagic Zone, where the pressure keeps rising the further you go down. It's a good thing you have the pressure gauge to keep your equipment from breaking."

Their scientific name is Labroides Dimidiatus, and commonly called the Blue Streak Cleaner Wrasse.'"

There is no light besides the animals around, which are harder to see through scuba goggles."

The Abyssopelagic Zone is down of the Abyssal Zone Border. "A pitch black area, which now you have reached the very sea floor. Hydrothermal Vents surround parts of the area, with small sea mounts and siphonophores drifting peacefully in the black zone.

They relate to other Siphonophores, like the Giant Siphonophore, which is bioluminescent of a bright blue light if it bumps into something.'"

The Hydrothermal Vent Field is west of the Abyssopelagic Zone. "Hydrothermal Vents, or steep hills with hot steam coming out of them, make a large field for blind creatures to inhabit. They provide warmth to cold creatures who need warmth to survive the cold climate below, which is where the Hydrothermal Vents come in handy. Different types of crabs and shrimp live around this field."
The Yeti Crab is an animal in the Hydrothermal Vent Field.
The creature facts of the Yeti Crab is "'The Yeti Crab is a type of decapod that has different names, such as yeti lobster, or furry lobster.

They eat bacteria and mussels, and at the weight of 2-5 pounds. The Yeti Crab's size is 15 cm (or 6 inches) and their lifespan is around 10-20 years. The number of species is 5, the colors range around from pale white, grey, and yellow.'"
